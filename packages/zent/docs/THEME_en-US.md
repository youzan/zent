## Themes

Zent supports themes, only colors are customizable for now.

### Customize through CSS variables

Zent uses [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), so it is possible to customize themes via custom CSS variables.

Override theme color with CSS variables:
```css
:root {
  --theme-primary-1: 37, 43, 110;
  --theme-primary-2: 60, 70, 177;
  --theme-primary-3: 67, 79, 201;
  --theme-primary-4: 81, 95, 240;
  --theme-primary-5: 108, 120, 242;
  --theme-primary-6: 126, 136, 243;
  --theme-primary-7: 176, 182, 248;
  --theme-primary-8: 242, 243, 254;
}
```

It is recommended that these CSS variables are generated by code, here is an [example](https://gist.github.com/cpylua/247a2ac8da6adfe2354daceb352dcdea).

### Customize through rebuilding SCSS

Styles in Zent are written in [scss](https://sass-lang.com), we have a builtin theme extension file to support custom themes. You can build custom styles using this extension file.

This method is non-intrusive, but you have to manually build your custom theme every time you upgrade Zent.

#### Build Steps

1. Clone Zent from [github](https://github.com/youzan/zent) and install dependencies
2. Create a file named [`_override.scss`](https://github.com/youzan/zent/blob/master/packages/zent/assets/theme/_override_.scss) in `packages/zent/assets`, define your custom colors in this file. All customizable colors are defined in [`_default.scss`](https://github.com/youzan/zent/blob/master/packages/zent/assets/theme/_default.scss) within the same directory.
3. Run `yarn theme` within `packages/zent`
4. Your custom theme styles are in `packages/zent/css`.

<style>
  img[alt="zent-theme"] {
    width: 514px;
    height: 319px;
  }
</style>
