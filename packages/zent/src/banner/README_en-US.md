## Banner

Deliver promotional messages to users

### Suggestion

- Usage: Used to pass product promotion information to users. The bulletin exists until it is processed or closed by the user.
- Location: The announcement is usually located above the container of the content area of the page and below the navigation bar. It ADAPTS to the width of the content area.

### Note

- Use announcements only when necessary, and limit them to the task interface related to their content. Frequent use may cause users to pay less attention to announcements;
- Do not stack multiple bulletins. If multiple bulletins exist on a single page, only the bulletins with the highest priority are displayed.
