## Dropdown

Dropdown menu, often used with `Menu`.

### API

Please refer to [the api doc of `Popover`](popover#api), `Dropdown` only sets some default values for props.

`DropdownButton` supports all `Button` props, the difference is it is aware of `Dropdown` content visible changes.

### About position

It's recommanded to use `AutoXxxYxx` provided by `Popover` for positioning. E.g. it's positioned below the lower left corner, but the position will be adjusted if it's out of the screen.

Alternative ways for positioning can be refered to [the position doc of `Popover`](popover#position%20api)ã€‚
