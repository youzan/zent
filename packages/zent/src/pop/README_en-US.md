#### `adjustPosition`

Use this function to manually adjust `Pop` position.

#### `getWrappedPopover`

Use this function to get the internal `Popover` instance.

### FAQ

#### centerArrow

`Pop` aligns edges of its content and trigger by default, the distance between the arrow and content edge is fixed except when `position` is set to `'*-center'`. The arrow will appear outside of trigger's edge when trigger size is small. When this happens you can set `centerArrow` to `true` to always align arrow to trigger's center.

#### onConfirm and onCancel

These two callbacks supports asynchronous mode, buttons will change into loading state when pending on result.

- If return value is a `Promise`, `Pop` will close on `Promise` `resolve`.
- If callback has parameters, it will be called with a `close` argument, `Pop` will not close until you call `close`.
