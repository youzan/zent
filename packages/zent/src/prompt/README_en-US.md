## Prompt

Pass system prompts to users

#### Suggestion

- Use: Used to deliver product or system prompts to users. It has nothing to do with the user's task or state and will exist until processed or closed by the user.
- Location: Tips for the global page are usually located at the top of the content area container and are adaptive to the container width; The prompt for a form item is usually located above or below the form item, and the width can be customized by the business.

#### Note

- Use hints only when necessary and limit them to the task interface related to their content. Frequent use may cause users to pay less attention to the prompt;
- Do not stack multiple prompts in the same position.
- If a message is generated by a task rather than the system, use the StatusBar.
- For more lightweight interactions, use [?] Folding help information;
