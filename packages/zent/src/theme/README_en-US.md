## Themes

Zent supports themes, only colors are customizable for now.

### Customize through CSS variables

Zent uses [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), so it is possible to customize themes via custom CSS variables.

Each theme color should be provided in both HEX and RGB format, These variables as follows:

### Customize through rebuilding SCSS

Styles in Zent are written in [scss](https://sass-lang.com), we have a builtin theme extension file to support custom themes. You can build custom styles using this extension file.

This method is non-intrusive, but you have to manually build your custom theme every time you upgrade Zent.

#### Build Steps

1. Clone Zent from [github](https://github.com/youzan/zent) and install dependencies
2. Create a file named [`_override.scss`](https://github.com/youzan/zent/blob/master/packages/zent/assets/theme/_override_.scss) in `packages/zent/assets`, define your custom colors in this file. All customizable colors are defined in [`_default.scss`](https://github.com/youzan/zent/blob/master/packages/zent/assets/theme/_raw-vars.scss) within the same directory.
3. Run `yarn theme` within `packages/zent`
4. Your custom theme styles are in `packages/zent/css`.

#### Modify theme color dynamically

Could use `ThemeSdk API`, pass a basic color to update the theme colors. Choose a color with a higher saturation and brightness, please. like: S > 85, B > 80, like the following:
