### Principle

- The widget is mainly used to insert it's `child` to given DOM node, and it is removed from DOM when component is unmounted.
- A certain degree of repaint occurs when any props are modified, and `children`, `selector`'s change will trigger component `unmount` to `mount`; when other props is modified, only existing DOM node attributes update.

### Known issues

- Using string `ref` on Portal's `children` throws error, to avoid this question, you can use functional `ref`. the reason is Portal's `chilren` has no owner, if you want to read more detail about this issue, click [ Here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v15.0.2/src/renderers/shared/reconciler/ReactRef.js#L18). Using string `ref` on Portal's `children` is also not encouraged by official react team.

- On `15.0.2` version,  React has a bug that the `context` rely on `state` does not update in some case(refer to example: 02-context), please wait React version updates
