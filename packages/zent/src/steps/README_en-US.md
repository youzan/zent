## Steps

Located in the head of the form, it is used for step by step display of large or strong logical forms, providing jump ability.

#### Suggestion

- When the task is complex or there is a sequence relationship, the step bar can be divided into multiple steps to simplify the user's cognition and operation cost of each step and feedback the current state.
- `Step` is used when a large volume or strong logical form needs to be displayed step by step and the skipping ability is provided.
- When a task contains multiple nodes with contextual relationship and needs to feedback the task flow status, the `Indicator` is used.
- If only the progress of a task does not contain multiple nodes, use the `Progress`.
- If the content can be split into multiple sub-contents without any logical relationship, use `Tabs`.
